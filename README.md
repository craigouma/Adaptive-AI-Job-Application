## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Frontend (React + TypeScript)
- **ApplicationFlow**: Main application component managing the flow
- **QuestionCard**: Renders individual questions with various input types
- **ProgressIndicator**: Shows completion progress with visual feedback
- **RoleToggle**: Dropdown selector for choosing job roles
- **CompletionCard**: Displays success message and next steps
- **AdminDashboard**: Complete admin interface with analytics

### Backend (Supabase Edge Functions)
- **next-question**: Determines the next question based on current answers using AI
- **submit-application**: Saves completed applications to the database
- **admin-applications**: Retrieves applications for admin dashboard
- **admin-analytics**: Provides application analytics and insights
- **admin-score-candidate**: AI-powered candidate scoring system

### Database (PostgreSQL)
- **applications**: Stores application data with role, answers, status, and scores
- **admin_users**: Admin authentication system

## üõ†Ô∏è How Adaptive Question Logic Works

The application uses a sophisticated question flow system powered by Groq AI:

1. **Role Selection**: User chooses from 10 available job roles
2. **AI-Generated Questions**: Groq AI generates contextual questions based on:
   - Selected role and its requirements
   - Previous answers from the candidate
   - Current stage in the application process
3. **Dynamic Flow**: Questions are served one at a time, each building on previous responses
4. **Fallback System**: Predefined questions ensure the system works even without AI
5. **Progress Tracking**: Real-time updates show completion percentage
6. **Completion Detection**: System automatically detects when all questions are answered

### Supported Job Roles:
- **Frontend Engineer**: React, TypeScript, CSS, JavaScript focus
- **Product Designer**: UX/UI design, design systems, user research
- **Backend Engineer**: Server-side development, APIs, databases
- **Full Stack Engineer**: End-to-end development
- **Data Scientist**: Machine learning, data analysis, Python/R
- **DevOps Engineer**: Infrastructure, CI/CD, cloud platforms
- **Product Manager**: Product strategy, roadmap planning
- **UI/UX Designer**: Interface design, user experience
- **Mobile Developer**: iOS, Android, cross-platform development
- **QA Engineer**: Testing, automation, quality assurance

### Question Types Supported:
- **Text Input**: For names, emails, and short answers
- **Textarea**: For detailed responses and descriptions
- **Select Dropdown**: For multiple choice questions
- **Number Input**: For numeric values (experience years, etc.)

## üîß Setup & Configuration

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Supabase account
- Groq API key

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`:

```env
# Groq API Configuration
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here

# Supabase Configuration
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key
```

### Getting API Keys

#### Groq API Setup
1. Visit [Groq Console](https://console.groq.com)
2. Create an account and generate an API key
3. Copy the key to your `.env` file

#### Supabase Setup
1. Create a new project at [Supabase](https://supabase.com)
2. Go to Settings ‚Üí API
3. Copy the Project URL and anon key
4. Copy the service role key from the same page

### Database Setup
The application automatically creates the required database schema:

```sql
-- Applications table
CREATE TABLE applications (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  role text NOT NULL CHECK (role IN ('frontend-engineer', 'product-designer', ...)),
  answers jsonb NOT NULL DEFAULT '[]'::jsonb,
  status text DEFAULT 'pending',
  score integer,
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);

-- Admin users table
CREATE TABLE admin_users (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  email text UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  password_hash text NOT NULL,
  role text DEFAULT 'admin',
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);
```
